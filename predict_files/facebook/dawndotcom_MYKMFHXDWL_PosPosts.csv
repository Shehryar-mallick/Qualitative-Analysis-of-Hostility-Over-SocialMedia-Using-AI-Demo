10166620951630442,"Manchester City won the Premier League for the fourth time in five seasons after a pulsating title race reached a dramatic conclusion as the champions staged an incredible comeback from two goals down to beat Aston Villa 3-2 on Sunday.

Pep Guardiola's side were teetering on the brink of blowing the title after falling 2-0 behind midway through the second half at the Etihad Stadium.

But Ilkay Gundogan sparked an astonishing City revival as the German midfielder reduced the deficit before Rodri grabbed the equaliser.

Gundogan turned in City's third goal in the space of five minutes in the 81st minute, triggering wild celebrations and rendering second-placed Liverpool's 3-1 victory against Wolves irrelevant.

City finished with 93 points, one ahead of Liverpool as they ended their rivals' hopes of winning an unprecedented quadruple.

On a breathtaking final day, Burnley were relegated as Leeds beat the drop, while Tottenham qualified for the Champions League at the expense of their north London rivals Arsenal.

It was City who hogged the spotlight on a day their fans, who spilled onto the pitch in delight, will never forget.

Guardiola's men can rightly be called a dynasty after joining Manchester United as the only clubs in the Premier League era to have won four titles in five seasons, with Alex Ferguson's teams doing it on three separate occasions.

The first information report (FIR) against Khan, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered in Thatta's Dhabeji police station under Sections 131 (incitement to mutiny), 153 (provoking to cause riot), 452 (trespassing) and 505 (statement conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

The FIR said that the complainant had heard Khan allegedly talking against the army and the institutions in a ""derogatory and provocative language"" on social media.

Meanwhile, a pair of FIRs were also registered against anchorperson Arshad Sharif on Friday and Thursday in Hyderabad and Karachi. The FIRs, copies of which are available with Dawn.com, were registered under Sections 131, 153 and 505 of the PPC.

They referred to Sharif's comments in a conversation with journalist Matiullah Jan on his YouTube channel wherein he allegedly ""disrespected"" state institutions and uttered statements that attempted to ""spread hate in the army and create a hateful atmosphere"".

Another FIR in Dadu, registered on Friday under PPC Sections 131, 153 and 505, mentioned Sharif and fellow ARY News journalist Sabir Shakir. The FIR said that ""derogatory language"" regarding state institutions was used in a conversation between the two and analogies were drawn to Mir Jafar and Mir Sadiq. It added that the two were inciting people against the army and state institutions.

10166620437590442,"Global health officials have sounded the alarm over rising cases in Europe and elsewhere of monkeypox, a type of viral infection more common to west and central Africa.

As of Friday, some 80 monkeypox cases have been confirmed and an additional 50 are under investigation in 11 countries, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The risk to the general public is low at this time, a US public health official told reporters at a briefing on Friday.

Monkeypox is a virus that can cause symptoms including fever, aches and presents with a distinctive bumpy rash.

It is related to smallpox, but is usually milder, particularly the West African strain of the virus that was identified in a US case, which has a fatality rate of around 1 per cent. Most people fully recover in two to four weeks, the official said.

The virus is not as easily transmitted as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spurred the global Covid-19 pandemic.

As of Friday, some 80 monkeypox cases have been confirmed and an additional 50 are under investigation in 11 countries, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The risk to the general public is low at this time, a US public health official told reporters at a briefing on Friday.

Monkeypox is a virus that can cause symptoms including fever, aches and presents with a distinctive bumpy rash.

It is related to smallpox, but is usually milder, particularly the West African strain of the virus that was identified in a US case, which has a fatality rate of around 1 per cent. Most people fully recover in two to four weeks, the official said.

The virus is not as easily transmitted as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spurred the global Covid-19 pandemic.

10166620388365442,"Balochistan government spokesperson Farah Azeem Shah on Sunday said she was confident that the devastating forest fire on the Koh-i-Sulaiman range would be put out by today as the army, provincial and federal disaster management authorities and other officials had amped up efforts.

Reports of the blaze emerged a week ago after the area was struck by lightning and has since engulfed hundreds of trees dotting the mountain range, home to the world’s largest pine nuts (chilghoza) forest and connects Balochistan, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.

It has now turned into a raging inferno, forcing several residents of nearby villages to move to safer locations. Different species of animals and birds are also under threat.

So far three Zhob residents have lost their lives trying to douse to the blaze, the Zhob division commissioner Bashir Baazi told Dawn.com. Baazi said efforts are being made to control the fire but the fire is increasing but a fire barrier had been set up to control the fire which, he too, said would soon be brought under control.

In a media talk in Quetta today, Shah said that the government has formed a task force for a rescue operation in the Shirani district, which is the most threatened from the fire.

""An emergency has been declared in Zhob and a control room has been established in the forest and wildlife departments,"" she stated. ""Apart from that, three ambulances, two army helicopters, one fire truck, one van, one satellite vehicle and 15 workers have been dispatched there.""

10166620367525442,"A teenage girl was abducted at gunpoint near Lahore's Shadbagh area, the police said on Sunday.

According to CCTV footage of the crime, available with Dawn.com, the tenth grader, who could be seen clad in a burqa, was sitting behind her brother on a motorcycle when a white Suzuki Wagon R stopped the siblings midway.

As soon as the motorcycle stopped, two armed men got out of the car. One of them grabbed the girl's hand and forced her into the vehicle, while the other man pointed a gun at her brother and prevented him from rescuing his sister.

After abducting the teenager, the men can be seen driving away from the crime scene.

The incident reportedly took place yesterday, police said.

A day after the incident, the Shadbagh police registered an FIR of kidnapping against unidentified suspects on the complaint of the missing girl’s father, Zulfiqar Ali, under Section 365B (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel for marriage etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

10166618327095442,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC), in late hours of Saturday, ordered the release of PTI leader Shireen Mazari and instructed the government to conduct a judicial inquiry.

The court issued the orders hours after instructing the interior secretary to produce the PTI leader at 11:30pm. Mazari was manhandled and arrested from outside her Islamabad residence earlier in the day by police officials over a land ownership and transfer case.

At the onset of the hearing, Mazari told the court: ""I was stopped on the motorway for an hour. A male doctor tried to conduct my medical examination. They did not have a female officer with them. Officers of Anti-Corruption Punjab were taking instructions on the phone. My bag was also searched without a warrant, while I have still not been given my phone back.""

""There was another person with the anti-corruption officials and he probably was with the ISI,"" she added.

At this, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rued that the government had not taken any action on enforced disappearances. ""These incidents happen when the Constitution is not respected. Every government exhibits woeful behaviour on constitutional violations.""

Prior to the start of the hearing, Mazari was brought to the high court by Islamabad police, whose officers flanked her as she walked into the court premises. Outside the court, she was reunited with her daughter Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir.

In a walking interview with reporters, when asked who was behind her arrest, Mazari said: ""[It was either] PML-N's Rana Sanaullah and Shehbaz Sharif or the intelligence agencies.""

When asked how she was treated, she said: ""I will tell that in the court. They dragged me out of the car, did not show any warrant ...""

When asked again that on whose order she was arrested, Mazari responded: ""This we do not yet but those who were taking me to Lahore, they said Rana Sanaullah and Shehbaz Sharif. The torture that they have done on me, I will tell it all.""
