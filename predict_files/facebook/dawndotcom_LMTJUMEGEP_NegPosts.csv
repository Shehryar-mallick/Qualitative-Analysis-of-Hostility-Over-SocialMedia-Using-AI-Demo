10166620951630442,"Manchester City won the Premier League for the fourth time in five seasons after a pulsating title race reached a dramatic conclusion as the champions staged an incredible comeback from two goals down to beat Aston Villa 3-2 on Sunday.

Pep Guardiola's side were teetering on the brink of blowing the title after falling 2-0 behind midway through the second half at the Etihad Stadium.

But Ilkay Gundogan sparked an astonishing City revival as the German midfielder reduced the deficit before Rodri grabbed the equaliser.

Gundogan turned in City's third goal in the space of five minutes in the 81st minute, triggering wild celebrations and rendering second-placed Liverpool's 3-1 victory against Wolves irrelevant.

City finished with 93 points, one ahead of Liverpool as they ended their rivals' hopes of winning an unprecedented quadruple.

On a breathtaking final day, Burnley were relegated as Leeds beat the drop, while Tottenham qualified for the Champions League at the expense of their north London rivals Arsenal.

It was City who hogged the spotlight on a day their fans, who spilled onto the pitch in delight, will never forget.

Guardiola's men can rightly be called a dynasty after joining Manchester United as the only clubs in the Premier League era to have won four titles in five seasons, with Alex Ferguson's teams doing it on three separate occasions.

10166620437590442,"Global health officials have sounded the alarm over rising cases in Europe and elsewhere of monkeypox, a type of viral infection more common to west and central Africa.

As of Friday, some 80 monkeypox cases have been confirmed and an additional 50 are under investigation in 11 countries, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The risk to the general public is low at this time, a US public health official told reporters at a briefing on Friday.

Monkeypox is a virus that can cause symptoms including fever, aches and presents with a distinctive bumpy rash.

It is related to smallpox, but is usually milder, particularly the West African strain of the virus that was identified in a US case, which has a fatality rate of around 1 per cent. Most people fully recover in two to four weeks, the official said.

The virus is not as easily transmitted as the SARS-CoV-2 virus that spurred the global Covid-19 pandemic.

10166620391425442,"Former finance minister Shaukat Tarin on Sunday said the incumbent government has lost ""credibility"" before the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as it is struggling to strike a deal, claiming ""they are now seeking help from us"".

Tarin's comments come in the backdrop of the coalition government's ongoing talks with the IMF over the release of a $1 billion tranche under an Extended Fund Facility, a process slowed by concerns about the pace of economic reforms in the country.

Earlier this week, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail had told the IMF — during the talks — that the government understood the current economic crisis and agreed that it would have to take ""tough decisions"" while mitigating the effects of inflation on the middle to low-income groups.

At a press conference in Karachi today, Tarin dismissed the claims by the PML-N-led coalition government that the PTI government reneged on its promises made with the IMF. ""We, in fact, had renegotiated the deal. But the IMF is not trusting this new government and they are now asking us to help.""

The ex-minister said the PTI wanted a strong interim government to be in place and hold elections. ""When the interim government is there, we will help them and show them the way forward,"" he added.

Tarin also said the government was struggling to run affairs.

10166620386055442,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) said it expects to identify more cases of monkeypox as it expands surveillance in countries where the disease is not typically found.

As of Saturday, 92 confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 12 member states that are not endemic for the virus, the UN agency said, adding it will provide further guidance and recommendations in the coming days for countries on how to mitigate the spread of monkeypox.

In recent weeks, cases have been detected in Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden as well as in the United States, Canada and Australia, raising fears the virus may be spreading.

Israel also reported its first case on Saturday, signalling the virus' spread to the Middle East.

Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. The virus can be transmitted through contact with skin lesions or droplets from a contaminated person, as well as through shared items such as bedding or towels. Since it is spread by close contact, it can be relatively easily contained through such measures as self-isolation and hygiene.

10166620382855442,"A Punjab Assembly session — in which the no-confidence motions against Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and Deputy Speaker Dost Mazari were to be held — was put off to June 6 after the no-trust motion against the speaker was dismissed.

As lawmakers were unable to enter due to police, the no-confidence motion against Speaker Elahi was scuttled on technical grounds as no member of the PML-N could present it against him.

As soon as the session started, under the panel of chairs in the absence of any lawmaker, it was adjourned to June 6.

Afterwards, Khalil Tahir Sindhu of the PML-N said that the session was adjourned on ""unlawful grounds"" and that they would move against the speaker again today. ""Nowhere in the law is it said that once a motion is rejected, it cannot be re-introduced.""

Earlier, MPAs from the PML-N-led coalition alleged that some PTI and PML-Q lawmakers were allowed inside, and held Elahi responsible for it, while the speaker blamed the ""father-son duo"" of PM Shehbaz Sharif and CM Hamza Shehbaz.

The session was scheduled to begin at 12:30pm. Elahi had summoned lawmakers to arrive at the assembly half an hour before.

India is the world's second biggest wheat producer, but the government — itself the country's biggest buyer of the crop — said it chose to protect food security for its mammoth population despite inflation concerns.

The move — along with dwindling global supplies from Russia and Ukraine, both among the world's top five wheat exporters — sent prices to all-time highs on commodity exchanges in Chicago and Europe.

But at Asia's largest grain market in Khanna, in India's breadbasket state of Punjab, values went the other way.

10166618327095442,"The Islamabad High Court (IHC), in late hours of Saturday, ordered the release of PTI leader Shireen Mazari and instructed the government to conduct a judicial inquiry.

The court issued the orders hours after instructing the interior secretary to produce the PTI leader at 11:30pm. Mazari was manhandled and arrested from outside her Islamabad residence earlier in the day by police officials over a land ownership and transfer case.

At the onset of the hearing, Mazari told the court: ""I was stopped on the motorway for an hour. A male doctor tried to conduct my medical examination. They did not have a female officer with them. Officers of Anti-Corruption Punjab were taking instructions on the phone. My bag was also searched without a warrant, while I have still not been given my phone back.""

""There was another person with the anti-corruption officials and he probably was with the ISI,"" she added.

At this, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rued that the government had not taken any action on enforced disappearances. ""These incidents happen when the Constitution is not respected. Every government exhibits woeful behaviour on constitutional violations.""

Prior to the start of the hearing, Mazari was brought to the high court by Islamabad police, whose officers flanked her as she walked into the court premises. Outside the court, she was reunited with her daughter Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir.

In a walking interview with reporters, when asked who was behind her arrest, Mazari said: ""[It was either] PML-N's Rana Sanaullah and Shehbaz Sharif or the intelligence agencies.""

When asked how she was treated, she said: ""I will tell that in the court. They dragged me out of the car, did not show any warrant ...""

When asked again that on whose order she was arrested, Mazari responded: ""This we do not yet but those who were taking me to Lahore, they said Rana Sanaullah and Shehbaz Sharif. The torture that they have done on me, I will tell it all.""
