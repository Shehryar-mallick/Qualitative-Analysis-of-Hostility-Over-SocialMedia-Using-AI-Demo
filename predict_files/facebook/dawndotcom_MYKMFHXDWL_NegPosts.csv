10166620391425442,"Former finance minister Shaukat Tarin on Sunday said the incumbent government has lost ""credibility"" before the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as it is struggling to strike a deal, claiming ""they are now seeking help from us"".

Tarin's comments come in the backdrop of the coalition government's ongoing talks with the IMF over the release of a $1 billion tranche under an Extended Fund Facility, a process slowed by concerns about the pace of economic reforms in the country.

Earlier this week, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail had told the IMF — during the talks — that the government understood the current economic crisis and agreed that it would have to take ""tough decisions"" while mitigating the effects of inflation on the middle to low-income groups.

At a press conference in Karachi today, Tarin dismissed the claims by the PML-N-led coalition government that the PTI government reneged on its promises made with the IMF. ""We, in fact, had renegotiated the deal. But the IMF is not trusting this new government and they are now asking us to help.""

The ex-minister said the PTI wanted a strong interim government to be in place and hold elections. ""When the interim government is there, we will help them and show them the way forward,"" he added.

Tarin also said the government was struggling to run affairs.

10166620386055442,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) said it expects to identify more cases of monkeypox as it expands surveillance in countries where the disease is not typically found.

As of Saturday, 92 confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 12 member states that are not endemic for the virus, the UN agency said, adding it will provide further guidance and recommendations in the coming days for countries on how to mitigate the spread of monkeypox.

In recent weeks, cases have been detected in Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden as well as in the United States, Canada and Australia, raising fears the virus may be spreading.

Israel also reported its first case on Saturday, signalling the virus' spread to the Middle East.

Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. The virus can be transmitted through contact with skin lesions or droplets from a contaminated person, as well as through shared items such as bedding or towels. Since it is spread by close contact, it can be relatively easily contained through such measures as self-isolation and hygiene.

As lawmakers were unable to enter due to police, the no-confidence motion against Speaker Elahi was scuttled on technical grounds as no member of the PML-N could present it against him.

As soon as the session started, under the panel of chairs in the absence of any lawmaker, it was adjourned to June 6.

Afterwards, Khalil Tahir Sindhu of the PML-N said that the session was adjourned on ""unlawful grounds"" and that they would move against the speaker again today. ""Nowhere in the law is it said that once a motion is rejected, it cannot be re-introduced.""

Earlier, MPAs from the PML-N-led coalition alleged that some PTI and PML-Q lawmakers were allowed inside, and held Elahi responsible for it, while the speaker blamed the ""father-son duo"" of PM Shehbaz Sharif and CM Hamza Shehbaz.

The session was scheduled to begin at 12:30pm. Elahi had summoned lawmakers to arrive at the assembly half an hour before.

10166620375465442,"Ukraine ruled out a ceasefire or concessions to Moscow while Russia intensified an offensive in the eastern Donbas region and stopped providing gas to Finland, as Polish President Andrzej Duda prepared to address the Ukrainian parliament on Sunday.

After ending weeks of resistance by the last Ukrainian fighters in the strategic southeastern city of Mariupol, Russia is waging a major offensive in Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas.

Russian-backed separatists already controlled swathes of territory in Luhansk and the neighbouring Donetsk province before the Feb. 24 invasion, but Moscow wants to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Donbas.

“The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address.

The Russian army was trying to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Sievierodonetsk, but Ukrainian forces were holding off their advance, he said.

Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak ruled out agreeing to a ceasefire and said Kyiv would not accept any deal with Moscow that involved ceding territory.

Making concessions would backfire on Ukraine because Russia would hit back harder after any break in fighting, he said.

India is the world's second biggest wheat producer, but the government — itself the country's biggest buyer of the crop — said it chose to protect food security for its mammoth population despite inflation concerns.

The move — along with dwindling global supplies from Russia and Ukraine, both among the world's top five wheat exporters — sent prices to all-time highs on commodity exchanges in Chicago and Europe.

But at Asia's largest grain market in Khanna, in India's breadbasket state of Punjab, values went the other way.

10166617899620442,"President Arif Alvi has asked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to reconsider his advice to the former about the appointment of a new Punjab governor, maintaining that Omar Cheema, who was removed from the post on May 9, still holds the office and ""there is no occasion to propose a new appointment"".

According to a statement issued by the President's Secretariat on Saturday, Alvi referred to an earlier communication to the prime minister, dated May 9, in which he had rejected the PM's advice for removing Cheema from office, stating that ""the Governor shall hold office during the pleasure of the President"", as envisaged by Article 101 (2) of the Constitution.

However, Cheema was removed hours later, with a late night notification of the Cabinet Division stating that he had ceased to hold office on the advice of the prime minister sent to the president on two occasions.

In today's communication, the president reiterated this stance and said that ""the present circumstances demanded that the incumbent governor should continue to hold that position"".

The president also referred to a letter that Cheema had written to him on April 23, and a report dated May 4. Both these documents, he said, highlighted the change in loyalties during the election of the Punjab chief minister on April 16 — where Hamza Shehbaz garnered majority votes with 25 dissident PTI lawmakers throwing their support behind him — and ""cobbling of the majority by illegal means"" which had generated ""serious governance issues in the province, as well as violated Article 63-A of the Constitution"".

Article 63-A pertains to the disqualification of lawmakers on the basis of defection and in a recent ruling on a presidential reference, the Supreme Court said the votes of defecting lawmakers would not be counted.

President Alvi referred to the ruling saying that it ""vindicated"" the ""principled stand of the governor (Cheema)"".

Shehbaz and Hamza were set to be indicted in the case in the previous hearing on May 14 but it was delayed because the prime minister was in the UK and postponed his return to the country in order to visit the UAE to offer condolences over the death of its president.

At the outset of the hearing, Judge Awan observed that conditions outside the court were ""not good"", referring to security personnel obstructing the entry of people onto the court premises. PM Shehbaz responded that he would look into the matter.

The judge also expressed anger at the SP Civil Lines for stopping judges' vehicles from entering the court.

10166617804355442,"PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz on Saturday defended the arrest of former human rights minister and PTI leader Shireen Mazari by police officials, saying that no one was above the law.

Addressing the PML-N's social media team in Lahore soon after Mazari's arrest, Maryam said: ""If the Anti-Corruption [Establishment] arrested her then they must have a reason to do so.""

Maryam said she found out of Mazari's arrest through the news, adding that ""I wasn't happy to hear this.""

Narrating the reported details of the case against Mazari, Maryam claimed it was registered during the government of former Punjab chief minister Usman Buzdar and involved the transfer of 800 kanals of state property to a ""bogus company"".

""I was hearing on TV that the PTI is playing the aurat (woman) card on this [incident] that a woman was arrested,"" she said. Maryam warned the PTI not to resort to the aurat card as she narrated the details and circumstances of her own previous arrests and the ""treatment meted"" out to her.

""I didn't play the aurat card ... I was also a woman, someone's daughter and was in jail for a baseless political case but I never feigned being mazloom (oppressed).""

Despite that, Maryam said she did not believe in revenge. She said Mazari should face the charge she has been arrested on and provide answers and evidence to prove it wrong.

""If she is successful in this and proved innocent then I promise the nation that Maryam Nawaz Sharif will be the first one standing with her.""
