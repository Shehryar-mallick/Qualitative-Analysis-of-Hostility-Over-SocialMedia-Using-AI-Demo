Finance Minister Miftah Ismail recently pointed out that the subsidy allowed on petrol for May and June would cost Rs. 96 billion, which the government cannot bear.

A week ago, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) recommended an increase in prices of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs. 119 per liter, and of petrol by Rs. 83.50 per liter. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided not to approve that increase because of ‚Äúpolitical consideration‚Äù.

However, now, the petroleum division is considering reversing that decision. An official source told the media that the government is planning to increase petrol and diesel by a flat Rs. 20 per liter and then periodically increase the prices and remove the subsidy unless the global prices witness a significant drop.

Miftah Ismail and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi have gone on record to announce that the subsidy will be ending soon as the current international prices are too high.

On WhatsApp, 'last seen' lets other users know when someone last opened the app, and could hint at whether they checked the app without responding to a message. Currently, you can hide your 'last seen' from everyone, but that means you can't see anyone else's, either. There's also an option to set 'last seen' to your contacts only, but you can't choose specific people to be privy to it.

The new feature will add ""My Contacts Except..."" to this list, making it possible to block certain people from viewing your 'last seen.' It's currently in beta for both iOS and Android, and will hopefully be released to all of WhatsApp soon.
