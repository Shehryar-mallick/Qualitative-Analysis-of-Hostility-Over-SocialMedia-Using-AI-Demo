What is more interesting is that the report is printed on recyclable paper, to ensure a clean and green Pakistan.

According to the report, 2021 was an exemplary year in terms of its sustainability efforts, as well as a challenging one as the country saw several peaks of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. But Zong kept itself as the digital and sustainability leader in the face of challenges and continued remarkable contributions across these critical sectors.

The stock closed down 35.1% on Wednesday, to $226.19 per share, marking Netflix’s biggest one-day drop ever in percentage terms. The company shed $54.4 billion in market capitalization overnight, the largest single-day decline in its history. The second-biggest drop came in January, when it saw $49 billion in market cap shaved off after Q4 subscriber adds came up short and Netflix warned of slowing growth.

Netflix shares sank to a more than four-year low — its lowest since shares closed at $220.46 on Jan. 19, 2018 — after the company posted a Q1 loss of 200,000 subscribers and projected that it will lose another 2 million subs in Q2, prompting a wave of analyst downgrades. Netflix shares have shed 65% of their value over the last six months.

One of the automotive groups may have suggested a solution to this problem.

He stated that:

""I am a businessman. That’s why I say that if something is cheaper in India, why should I buy that from another country? The transportation cost is less (from India). There are so many products that we could buy. We (the Nishat Group) make Hyundai cars. Hyundai India is very big. We could buy some parts cheaper from India, than buying from China, for example. And you are also trading with China in such a large way. Your imports from China are huge, and if you look at it, you also have issues with China on the issue of territories and all that.""
